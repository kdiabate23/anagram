# anagram
 A method that checks whether two words are anagrams. Two words are anagrams if they contain the same letters in any order. For example, silent and listen are anagrams. The header of the method is:

public static boolean isAnagram(String s1, String s2)

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two strings and, if they are anagrams, displays two strings are anagrams, and displays two strings are not anagrams if they are not anagrams.
